The class has several instance variables, including `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the position of the voxel in the grid, as well as `ft`, `bk`, `tp`, `bt`, `lt`, and `rt`, which represent the state of various flags for different actions that can be taken with the voxel. The class also has a constructor that initializes all of these variables. Overall, this code defines the basic structure of a voxel system and provides a foundation for further development and customization.","items":[{"id":"966d9406-10cf-87b9-cf48-ccbf10ccbb8e","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"represents a three-dimensional block with coordinates and various boolean flags for its properties.\nFields:\n\t- z (int): in the Block class represents the depth value of the block, with possible values ranging from 0 to 255. \n\t- rt (boolean): represents whether a block is right-clickable on the specific instance of the Block class. \n\n","name":"Block","code":"public class Block {\n\t\n\tpublic int x, y, z;\n\tpublic boolean ft, bk, tp, bt, lt, rt;\n\t\n\tpublic Block(int x, int y, int z) {\n\t\tthis.x = x;\n\t\tthis.y = y;\n\t\tthis.z = z;\n\t\t\n\t\tthis.ft = false;\n\t\tthis.bk = false;\n\t\tthis.tp = false;\n\t\tthis.bt = false;\n\t\tthis.lt = false;\n\t\tthis.rt = false;\n\t}\n\n}","location":{"start":3,"insert":3,"offset":" ","indent":0,"comment":null},"item_type":"class","length":19}]}}}
